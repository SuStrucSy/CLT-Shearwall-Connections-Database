# CLT-Shearwall-Connections-Database
This repository contains a comprehensive database of connections for cross-laminated timber (CLT) shearwall systems presenting qualitative and quantitative mechanical performance collected from experimental campaigns. This database is designed to support the growing adoption of mass timber construction. The database serves as a dynamic resource for designers and researchers, providing detailed insights into the mechanical performance of a wide variety of joinery types that can serve as a basis for connection and component level experiment development, numerical simulations, performance-based-design of multi-panel CLT shearwalls and so forth. 

### Version 1.0 : 
#### Key features:
