# CLT Shearwall Connections Database
### A comprehensive database of cross-laminated timber (CLT) shearwall connections presenting qualitative and quantitative mechanical performance collected from experimental campaigns. This database is designed to support research, design, and performance-based evaluation in mass timber construction. 

**Latest update:** 27 Aug 2025

---

## Overview

The database compiles data from 522 connection sets (2048 associated test specimens) spanning conventional (commercial) and R&D (experimental/innovative) joinery types used worldwide. It enables systematic assessment of connection performance under **in-plane tensile** and **shear loading**, supporting:

- Experimental development of new connection types  
- Numerical simulations and parametric studies  
- Performance-based design of multi-panel CLT shearwalls  

The database is **expandable and adaptable**, providing a framework for analytics-driven design and future research.

## Database Structure

The database consists of three main sections:

- **Metadata** ‚Äì Identification and specimen information, including assembly type, joinery type, fastener type, loading direction, and source.  
- **Structural Data** ‚Äì Geometric details, material properties, and connection configuration.  
- **Experimental Data** ‚Äì Quantitative and qualitative performance metrics, including load-deformation curves, failure modes, and associated input files.  

Connections are categorized into **Dowel-free** and **Dowel** types, and assemblies are classified as **Wall-Floor (WF)** or **Wall-Wall (WW)**. Determinative records enable systematic comparisons, while descriptive records provide supporting experimental and graphical information.

## Key Features

- **Extensive Data Collection:** Aggregated data from experimental studies worldwide.  
- **Performance Assessment:** Qualitative and quantitative metrics for tensile and shear loading.  
- **Timber Connections:** Includes commercial joinery and innovative R&D connections.  
- **Expandable Framework:** Users can expand the database horizontally (more records) and vertically (additional parameters).
