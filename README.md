# CLT-Shearwall-Connections-Database
This repository contains a comprehensive database of connections for cross-laminated timber (CLT) shearwall systems presenting qualitative and quantitative mechanical performance collected from experimental campaigns. This database is designed to support the growing adoption of mass timber construction. The database serves as a dynamic resource for designers and researchers, providing detailed insights into the mechanical performance of a wide variety of joinery types that can serve as a basis for connection and component level experiment development, numerical simulations, performance-based-design of multi-panel CLT shearwalls and so forth. 

### Version 1.0 : 
#### Key features:
- **Extensive Data Collection**  
  Aggregated and post-processed data from 505 group sets of connections, encompassing 1,979 associated test data points from mass timber construction practices and research worldwide.

- **Performance Assessment**  
  Qualitative and quantitative metrics evaluating the mechanical performance of connections under in-plane tensile and shear loading cases.

- **Timber Connections**  
  Includes commercially available timber joinery products as well as novel connection types developed through research and development efforts.

- **Expandable Framework**  
  Designed to be adaptable and expandable, enabling further exploration of structural behavior and analytics-driven, performance-based design methodologies.
